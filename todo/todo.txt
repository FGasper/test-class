* Get changes files in the new format
* Move away from RT
* Should SKIP_CLASS should skip all the tests or just one 
* $object->SKIP_ALL should just skip tests in current object
* Write some cookbook POD
* Look at David's patch to load Test::Classes on request
* Clarify why/where the xUnit style is useful in the docs
* See if we can steal anything neat from NUnit and Ruby's Test::Unit
* Annotate test description with the method name ?
* Clean up documentation for running multiple classes
* Consider using Test::Tester instead of Test::Builder::Tester
* Comment on http://martinfowler.com/bliki/JunitNewInstance.html
* See if there is anything new to steal in recent JUnit releases
* Think about ways to support multiple fixtures in a single class.
* Use the class variable style of test class in docs?
* Vary the order of test methods / classes easily
* Separate out Test::Class::Tutorial
* Check whether we can reduce the prerequisites
* Refactor test suite
* See whether the bizarre L<> syntax is still needed in POD
* Refactor runtests... lord is it ugly
* Mail out about the 1.0 release to perl-qa, tdd, agile-testing, etc.
* Look at using pperl/Module::Refresh and T::C together for faster startup times
* Look at rationalising the object/class behaviour
* Have another go on getting it on module list
* Add link to annocpan.org
* Make sure exit code logic matches that in the latest Test::Builder
* Have a ponder about how Test::Class and Test::Base might interact
* Consider renaming startup/teardown before/after like JUnit4
* Use JUnit 4.0's inheritance model for before/after running order?
* Have option to automatically add runtests to classes
* See what we can steal from TestNG
* You can't run classes just consisting of setup/teardown methods with tests coz it thinks there are no tests. Bug? Feature?
* ability to time test methods so we can run them in fastest-test order
* add ability to tag methods
* add ability to tag all methods in a class
* add more flexible approach to setting fixtures for a class
* look at integrating with role/trait modules
